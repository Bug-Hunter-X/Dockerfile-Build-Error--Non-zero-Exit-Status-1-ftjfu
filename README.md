This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error resulting in a non-zero exit status during the build process. The initial `Dockerfile` contains a missing dependency, causing the `pip install` command to fail. The corrected `Dockerfile.fixed` resolves this by adding the missing dependency to `requirements.txt`. This example highlights the importance of carefully managing dependencies in Dockerfiles to ensure successful builds.
